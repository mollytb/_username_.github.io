		<h2>Band Bio</h2>
        <p> Gaelic Storm is a modern Celtic folk band founded in the US by Patrick Murphy and Steve Twigger
        </p>
		<p>Gaelic Storm has been performing all over the world for over two decades.
			They began in a bar in Santa Monica where Patrick Murphy was working and where he met Steve Twigger. They were "discovered" playing there and became semi famous after playing for the Irish Party in the movie <em>Titanic</em>.
		</p>
		<p> With 11 albums available and a 12th being released in July 2018 they have created a mix of traditional Celtic music and their own rock sound. They continue to tour all over the country headlining Irish festivals and the House of Blues in Chicago regularly.
